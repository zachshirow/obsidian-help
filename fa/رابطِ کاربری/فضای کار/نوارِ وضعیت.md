The status bar shows handy information. That includes helpful information about the current file, the current vault, or the current status like time and date.

Status items are added both by [[افزونه‌های اصلی|core plugins]] and [[افزونه‌های انجمن]].

Some items are interactive but some are purely informational. For example, the [[واژه‌شمار]] plugin adds the word and character count that’s not clickable, and the [[مقدمه‌ای بر اوبسیدین سینک|Sync plugin]] adds an icon that both shows the sync status as well as shows the sync log upon being clicked.
