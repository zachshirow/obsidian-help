Many social networks display a rich preview for your website when a user shares a link to it.  Using [[فراداده]], you can customize how your notes appear in the preview.

## توضیحات

Obsidian automatically generates a description based on the note content, but you can provide your own using `description`.

```yaml
---
description: An introduction to our solar system.
---
```

> [!note] Meta tags
> `description` overrides the auto-generated description in `<meta name="description" content="...">` and the equivalents for `og:description` and `twitter:description`.

## تصویر

You can use a custom image for the link preview, by adding `image` or `cover` with a path to the image.

The path can be an absolute path from the root of your vault:

```yaml
---
cover: "Attachments/Cover image.png"
---
```

Or, an external URL:

```yaml
---
image: "https://example.com/cover%20image.png"
---
```

`image` and `cover` are identical. Only use one of them.
