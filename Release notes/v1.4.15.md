## Improvements

### Properties

- List property elements can now be edited. Right-click the list item and choose "Edit...".

### General

- The backlinks and word count status bar elements will be hidden if the active view does not support them.
- The icon for bookmarked files has been updated for clarity.
- Pressing `Enter` or `Tab` when the file titlebar is focused will not revert the filename if the new name is invalid. Instead, an error message will be shown and the titlebar will stay active.
- Improved layout of "About" settings tab.

## No longer broken
