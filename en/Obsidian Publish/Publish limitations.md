## Community plugins

Obsidian Publish has minimal support for [[Community plugins]]. 

Plugins which output in raw markdown, such as the Waypoint plugin, are compatible with Publish because they do not require the application to render their data. 

Whereas a plugin that requires a plugin codeblock to render, such as Dataview or Fantasy Statblocks, will not work by default in Publish. 

> [!tip] Members of our awesome [community](https://obsidian.md/community) have come up with workarounds to this limitation that may be worth checking out.
